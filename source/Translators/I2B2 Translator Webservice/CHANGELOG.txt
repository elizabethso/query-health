 Initial Version
7/16/12: Jeff Klann
 Web services no longer throw exceptions. Intended to help debug when some services don't produce a response.
7/17/12: Jeff Klann
 Added getChildren service.
7/23/12: Jeff Klann
 Now uses the two step conversion to HQMF and passes the subkey-age parameter through.
 Improved logging, but uses JUL and doesn't work correctly in JBoss. 
8/8/12: Jeff Klann
 Expects new XSL names.
10/2/12: Jeff Klann
 Now includes (untested, not fully implemented) modifier hook that aren't used anywhere.
1/30/13: Jeff Klann
 Passes alwaysUnroll through. No longer uses subkey-age. 
 
TODO list:
- Pass out the i2b2 auth information after HQMF conversion: wrapper/stuff in comments?
